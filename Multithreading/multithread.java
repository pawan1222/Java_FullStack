    Multithreading : 
	    Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
	    Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing.
	    Threads are independent, if there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. 
	    Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
	    But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a common memory area. They don't 
	    allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the threads takes less time
	    than process.
	    Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation etc.
	
    Advantage of Java Multithreading
        1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at same time.
        2) You can perform many operations together so it saves time.
        3) Threads are independent so it doesn't affect other threads if exception occur in a single thread.
	
    Multitasking :
	    Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. 
	    Multitasking can be achieved by two ways:
		    Process-based Multitasking(Multiprocessing)
		    Thread-based Multitasking(Multithreading)
		
    Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing) :
	    - Each process have its own address in memory i.e. each process allocates separate memory area.
	    - Process is heavyweight.
	    - Cost of communication between the process is high.
	    - Switching from one process to another require some time for saving and loading registers, memory maps, updating 
	    lists etc.
	
    Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading) :
	    - Threads share the same address space.
	    - Thread is lightweight.
	    - Cost of communication between the thread is low.
	
    Life cycle of a Thread (Thread States) :	
	    1.New
	    2.Runnable
	    3.Running
	    4.Non-Runnable (Blocked)
	    5.Terminated
	
	    The life cycle of the thread in java is controlled by JVM.

    1) New : 
	    The thread is in new state if you create an instance of Thread class but before the invocation of start() method.
	
    2) Runnable :
	    The thread is in runnable state after invocation of start() method, but the thread scheduler has not selected 
	    it to be the running thread.
	
    3) Running :
	    The thread is in running state if the thread scheduler has selected it.
	
    4) Non-Runnable (Blocked) :
	    This is the state when the thread is still alive, but is currently not eligible to run.
	
    5) Terminated :
	    A thread is in terminated or dead state when its run() method exits.

    How to create thread ? 
	    1.By extending Thread class
	    2.By implementing Runnable interface.
	
    Thread class: 
	    Thread class provide constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.
	    Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface.
	
    Commonly used Constructors of Thread class: 
	    Thread()
	    Thread(String name)
	    Thread(Runnable r)
	    Thread(Runnable r,String name)
	
    Commonly used methods of Thread class:
    1. public void run(): is used to perform action for a thread.
    2. public void start(): starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.
    3. public void sleep(long miliseconds): Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for 
	    the specified number of milliseconds.
    4. public void join(): waits for a thread to die.
    5. public void join(long miliseconds): waits for a thread to die for the specified miliseconds.
    6. public int getPriority(): returns the priority of the thread.
    7. public int setPriority(int priority): changes the priority of the thread.
    8. public String getName(): returns the name of the thread.
    9. public void setName(String name): changes the name of the thread.
    10. public Thread currentThread(): returns the reference of currently executing thread.
    11. public int getId(): returns the id of the thread.
    12. public Thread.State getState(): returns the state of the thread.
    13. public boolean isAlive(): tests if the thread is alive.
    14. public void yield(): causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
    15. public void suspend(): is used to suspend the thread(depricated).
    16. public void resume(): is used to resume the suspended thread(depricated).
    17. public void stop(): is used to stop the thread(depricated).
    18. public boolean isDaemon(): tests if the thread is a daemon thread.
    19. public void setDaemon(boolean b): marks the thread as daemon or user thread.
    20. public void interrupt(): interrupts the thread.
    21. public boolean isInterrupted(): tests if the thread has been interrupted.
    22. public static boolean interrupted(): tests if the current thread has been interrupted.

    Runnable interface: 
	    The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a 
	    thread. Runnable interface have only one method named run().
	
	    public void run(): is used to perform action for a thread.
	

        start() method of Thread class is used to start a newly created thread. 
    It performs following tasks:
	    A new thread starts(with new callstack).
	    The thread moves from New state to the Runnable state.
	    When the thread gets a chance to execute, its target run() method will run.
	
    After starting a thread, it can never be started again. If you does so, an IllegalThreadStateException is thrown. 
    In such case, thread will run once but for second time, it will throw exception.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thread Scheduler in Java :
	    Thread scheduler in java is the part of the JVM that decides which thread should run.
	    There is no guarantee that which runnable thread will be chosen to run by the thread scheduler.
	    Only one thread at a time can run in a single process.
	    The thread scheduler mainly uses preemptive or time-slicing scheduling to schedule the threads.
	
    Sleep method in java :
	    The sleep() method of Thread class is used to sleep a thread for the specified amount of time.	
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Daemon Thread in Java :
	    A Daemon Thread is a background thread that runs to support user threads.
	    When all user (non-daemon) threads finish, the JVM automatically terminates daemon threads.
	    Daemon thread runs in background
	    JVM does not wait for daemon threads
	    setDaemon(true) must be called before start()
	    It is a low priority thread.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
    Java Thread Pool :
	    Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reuse many times.
	    In case of thread pool, a group of fixed size threads are created. A thread from the thread pool is pulled
	    out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, thread is contained in the 
	    thread pool again.	
	    Better performance It saves time because there is no need to create new thread.
	    It is used in Servlet and JSP where container creates a thread pool to process the request.
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
    Synchronization in Java :
	    Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
	    Java Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
	    The synchronization is mainly used to
		    1.To prevent thread interference.
		    2.To prevent consistency problem
	
    Concept of Lock in Java: 
	    Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the lock or monitor. 
	    Every object has an lock associated with it. 
	    By convention, a thread that needs consistent access to an object's fields has to acquire the object's 
	    lock before accessing them, and then release the lock when it's done with them.
	
	
    Java synchronized method :	
	    If you declare any method as synchronized, it is known as synchronized method.
	    Synchronized method is used to lock an object for any shared resource.
	    When a thread invokes a synchronized method, it automatically acquires the lock for that object and 
	    releases it when the thread completes its task.
	
    Synchronized block in java :
	    Synchronized block can be used to perform synchronization on any specific resource of the method.
	    Suppose you have 50 lines of code in your method, but you want to synchronize only 5 lines, you can use
	    synchronized block.
	    If you put all the codes of the method in the synchronized block, it will work same as the synchronized method.	
	    Synchronized block is used to lock an object for any shared resource.
	    Scope of synchronized block is smaller than the method.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Deadlock in java :
	    Deadlock is a situation in Java where two or more threads are permanently blocked, each waiting for a 
	    lock held by another thread.
	
	
    Inter-thread communication in Java :
	    Inter-thread communication or Co-operation is all about allowing synchronized threads to communicate with 
	    each other.
	    Cooperation (Inter-thread communication) is a mechanism in which a thread is paused running in its critical 
	    section and another thread is allowed to enter (or lock) in the same critical section to be executed.
	    It is implemented by following methods of Object class:
		    wait()
		    notify()
		    notifyAll()	
	
    wait() method :
	    Causes current thread to release the lock and wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method 
	    or the notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
	    The current thread must own this object's monitor, so it must be called from the synchronized method only 
	    otherwise it will throw exception.	
	
    notify() method : 
	    Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
	    If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened. 
	    The choice is arbitrary and occurs at the discretion of the implementation.	
	
    notifyAll() method : 
	    Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.
