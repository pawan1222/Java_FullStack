    Stack : 
	It is a subclass of vector 
	It is a implemention class List
	It is present inside java.util package
	It is present since jdk 1.0v
	hench it is also known as legacy class
	It follows Fist In Last Out / Last In First Out insertion order
	It is used to perform stack operation.

To perform stack operation we have multiple methods in Stack class.
push(Object obj) :
	It is used to push object inside the stack.
	The return type is Object
peek() : 
	It is used to return top object of the stack.
	return type is Object.
	When stack empty and if we try to use peek method then it will throw EmptyStackException
pop() :
	It is used to return and remove the top element of the stack.
	return type is Object.
	When stack is empty and if try to use pop method then it will throw EmptyStackException
empty() :
	It is used to check whether the stack is empty or not.
	returntype is boolean.
