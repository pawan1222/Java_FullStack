Hashset:
    It is an implementation class of set interface.
    It is present inside java.util package.
    It was introduced in jdk 1.2v.
    It doesn't follow insertion order.
    It doesnt follow sorting order.
    It doesnt allow duplicate elements.
    It allows only one null value.
    It is based on hash table data structure.
    It provides fast performance for add, remove and search operation.
    It is used when uniqueness is required and order is not important.

    Sysntax:
        HashSet<Type> hs=new HashSet<>();

LinkedHashSet:
    It is an implementation class of set interface.
    It is present inside java.util package.
    It was introduced in jdk 1.4v.
    It follows insertion order.
    It doesnt follow sorting order.
    It doesnt allow duplicate elements.
    It allows only one null value.
    It is based on hash table and linked list data structure.
    It provides fast performance for add, remove and search operation.
    It is used when uniqueness is required along with maintaining insertion order.

    Syntax:
        LinkedHashSet<Type> lhs=new LinkedHashSet<>();
