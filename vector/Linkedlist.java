LinkedList:

    It is a implementing class of List interface, Queue Interface.
    It is present since jdk 1.2v.
    It follows doubly linkedlist data structure.
    It stores the object in the form of nodes because of this linkedlist is suitable for insertion and deletion operation.
    To perform backword and forward it use ListIterator cursor.
    
    Singly Linked List:
        Structure: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
        Traversal: Only in one direction (forward).

    Doubly Linked List:
        Structure: Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
        Traversal: Can be traversed forward and backward.

    Circular Doubly Linked List:
        Structure: Combines circular and doubly linked List features. Each node has pointers to both the next 
                   and previous nodes, and the last node points back to the first.
        Traversal: Both directions and continous looping.
